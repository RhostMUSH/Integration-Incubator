RhostMUSH Integration Incubator
=====
This repository is a fork off the main RhostMUSH trunk, and serves as a Rhost-side incubator tool for connecting third party frameworks and applications with Rhost.

Rhost-external integration code will, once it reaches a stable state, receive its own repository, like the already present 'Discord Relay'. Rhost-side code for integration will go into the Contribution/Softcode folder in the main Trunk repository.
